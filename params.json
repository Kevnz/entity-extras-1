Be\r\n  careful to not overwrite existing files.\r\n* Use in WM at will. A test level is included with the pack, inside\r\n  ./lib/game/levels.\r\n* Read the source code headers to better understand usage and options.\r\n\r\n# Info\r\n* Created by Alexandre Rousseau for [gamecubate](http://www.gamecubate.com)\r\n* Use at will but at own risk.\r\n* Sample project at http://www.gamecubate.com/playground/pin_triggers_and_blockers .\r\n* You can reach me by email (alexr at gamecubate dot com) or via the Impact\r\n  forums (alexandre).","tagline":"entity extras: PinTrigger, Blocker, ...","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
