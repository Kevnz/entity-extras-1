# Entity Extras for ImpactJS #

# Entities

* waypoint: This entity calls the triggeredBy method of one or more targets when it and another entity of a specific collision type overlap at the almost-same position.
* blocker: This entity stops the movement of all all triggering entities and releases them after a specified duration.

* Created by Alexandre Rousseau for [gamecubate](http://www.gamecubate.com); use at will but at own risk.
* Sample project at http://www.gamecubate.com/playground/waypoints_and_blockers .
* You can reach me by email (alexr at gamecubate dot com) or via the Impact forums (alexandre).

# Installation

* Just plop those entities you need into your lib/game/entities folder. Be careful to not overwrite
  existing files.
* Use in WM at will.
* Read the source code headers to better understand usage and options.
