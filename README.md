# Entity Extras for ImpactJS #

* PinTrigger: This entity calls the triggeredBy method of one or more
  targets when it and another entity of a specific collision type overlap at
  the almost-same position.
* Blocker: This entity stops the movement of all all triggering entities
  and releases them after a specified duration.

## Installation
* Just plop those entities you need into your lib/game/entities folder. Be
  careful to not overwrite existing files.
* Use in WM at will. A test level is included with the pack, inside
  ./lib/game/levels.
* Read the source code headers to better understand usage and options.
